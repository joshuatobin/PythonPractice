## Instructions

1. **Problem Overview:**  
   You are provided a CSV file with the following columns:  
   - `EmployeeID`: A unique identifier for each employee.  
   - `Name`: The full name of the employee.  
   - `Department`: The department the employee works in.  
   - `Salary`: The employee’s annual salary.  
   - `HireDate`: The date the employee was hired.  

   Your task is to write Python code that processes this file and answers the following questions:  
   - What is the average salary for each department?  
   - How many employees were hired in the last 5 years?  
   - Which department has the highest total payroll (sum of salaries)?  

2. **Instructions:**  
   - Parse the CSV data.  
   - Perform any necessary conversions (e.g., parsing dates, converting salary strings to numbers).  
   - Implement functions to compute the required answers.  
   - Output the results in a clear, readable format.  
   - You may use Python’s standard library (`csv`, `datetime`, etc.) for this task.  
   - Use the CSV file provided below.
